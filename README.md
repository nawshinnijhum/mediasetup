# Sample Media Files

This folder should contain:

## Audio Files

- `audio.mp3` - A sample audio file that will autoplay and loop
- `audio.ogg` - Optional: Ogg Vorbis format for better browser compatibility

## Video Files

- `video.mp4` - A sample video file that will autoplay, loop, and be muted
- `video.webm` - Optional: WebM format for better browser compatibility

## How to add your own media:

### For Audio:

1. Find a short audio clip (5-10 seconds works well for looping)
2. Convert to MP3 format if needed
3. Name it `audio.mp3` and place in this media/ folder

### For Video:

1. Find a short video clip (5-15 seconds works well for looping)
2. Convert to MP4 format if needed
3. Name it `video.mp4` and place in this media/ folder

## Sample Content Ideas:

- Audio: Nature sounds, ambient music, or sound effects
- Video: Animated graphics, nature scenes, or simple motion graphics

## Free Resources:

## Important Notes:

- Keep file sizes small for web deployment (audio < 5MB, video < 20MB)
- Ensure you have rights to use the media files
- Test autoplay functionality as browsers may block it without user interaction
